if your setup looks like this you are good to go 👍

## Reproducing Results 🔁 <a name="reproducing-results"></a>

We have deployed our Logistic Regression With under Sampling Model into the huggingface platform <br /> 

Model Link https://huggingface.co/spaces/FerasOo/stroke_prediction <br /> 

Inorder to recreate the same results as we did, just upload the test.csv file in csv file section in the left
